At first glance, it sounds strange, al-            most theatrical, marrying oneself? But            dig a little deeper and sologamy, as it’s            called, begins to reveal something pro-            found about our times. It’s less about ro-            mance and more about self-recognition            in a world that often tells us we’re in-            complete without someone else.             The Rise of Sologamy: A Quiet            Rebellion              Sologamy, literally, “marriage to one-            self”, isn’t a legal status (at least not rec-            ognized by governments), but it’s a sym-            bolic one. It’s part ceremony, part            statement and part self-love ritual. The            first widely publicized sologamous wed-            ding dates back to 1993, when Linda            Baker, a dental hygienist from Los An-            geles, held a ceremony to celebrate her            independence. Since then, social media            has amplified it, from women in Japan             18                                               www.revoir.in REVOIR Magazine | NOVEMBER 01 2025","India’s first self-                     marriage                  The Story of Kshama Bindu,              India’s First Self-Marriage                 In 2022, Kshama Bindu, a              young woman from Gujarat,              made global headlines by becom-              ing India’s first known “sologam-              ist.” Her self-marriage took place              at her home in Vadodara, com-              plete with rituals, a bridal sari              and a solo honeymoon to Goa.

Every note that spilled out            from its keys commanded attention.            From Chopin to Billy Joel, the piano            wasn’t just an instrument; it was the            heart of the home, the voice of the con-            cert hall, the test of musical mastery. But            as we step deeper into the 21st century,            with digital beats, AI-generated melodies            and pocket-sized synthesizers, one ques-            tion keeps echoing: is the piano still the            king of instruments?            The throne that defined western            music              For centuries, the piano has reigned            supreme. Invented around 1700 by Bar-            tolomeo Cristofori, it was a mechanical            miracle, a bridge between the delicate            harpsichord and the emotional range of            the human voice. It offered what no            other instrument could: dynamics. Pia-            nists could whisper or roar through a            piece simply by pressing harder or            softer. That subtlety became its power.              Through Mozart’s refinement, Bee-            thoven’s rebellion and Liszt’s showman-            ship, the piano became not just an instru-            ment but an empire. It shaped how            Western music was composed, per-            formed and even imagined. The phrase            “a piano in every home” wasn’t just as-            pirational; it was cultural doctrine in the            19th and early 20th centuries. Owning            one was a symbol of sophistication, edu-            cation and social status.
