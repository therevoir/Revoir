However,   EDITORIAL ADVISORY BOARD            modern lifestyles have eroded these bonds. Children today, caught up in fast-paced            careers, often lack time for their aging parents.

By Naina Kapoor                    very year, October 1st marks the                 International Day for the Elderly,            Ealso known as the International            Day of Older Persons, a day to rec-            ognize and honor the contributions of            the elderly to society. Established by the            United Nations in 1990, this day aims to            raise awareness about the rights and            needs of older people while promoting            their well-being and ensuring they re-            ceive the care and respect they deserve.            However, even in the 21st century, the            elderly face numerous challenges that            compromise their dignity, health, and            sense of belonging in society.             The aging global population: A            growing concern              Globally, the population is rapidly            aging. According to the World Health            Organization, by 2050, the world’s pop-            ulation aged 60 years and older is ex-            pected to total 2.1 billion, up from 1 bil-            lion in 2020. This sharp rise calls for            more comprehensive policies and sys-            tems to support older persons, especially            in areas of healthcare, social security,            and inclusivity. In developed nations            like the USA, UK, Australia, and New            Zealand, significant strides have been                                                          Elderly individuals feeling loneliness and isolation            made to cater to the elderly, such as spe-            cialized healthcare, legal frameworks for            elder rights, and social programs to            maintain their quality of life. Unfor-            tunately, in many other parts of the            world, these efforts are either lacking or            insufficient.

Many            countries, especially in the West, have            stringent visa regulations for older            adults due to the assumption that they            might not return to their home country,            opting to reside permanently with family            members abroad. This stereotype often            subjects elderly applicants to lengthy            documentation processes, medical clear-                                                         Daily life in an old age home            ances, and even additional scrutiny, de-            spite their genuine travel intentions. For            instance, elderly Indians looking to visit            children in countries like the United            States or the United Kingdom may face            obstacles due to assumptions about their            intentions to settle permanently, creating            emotional and logistical challenges for            families wishing to reunite across bor-            ders.              This visa difficulty reflects a broader            societal issue: the devaluation of older            persons' contributions to society and the            presumption that they are a burden. Ho-            wever, rather than limiting their mobil-            ity, governments should implement visa                                                          lderly woman with younger family members            processes that respect the dignity of the            elderly while maintaining the necessary            immigration safeguards.

The philosophy of non-violence              Non-violence, as a concept, involves            abstaining from the use of physical force            to achieve political, social, or personal            goals. This philosophy is deeply rooted            in respect for life, human dignity, and            the belief that true and lasting change            can only be achieved through peaceful            means.

Non-violence and conflict            resolution              Non-violent conflict resolution is a            key component of modern diplomacy            and peace-building efforts. Many inter-            national organizations, including the            United Nations, advocate for dialogue            and negotiation as alternatives to war.            Peace talks, ceasefires, and diplomatic            interventions have prevented numerous            conflicts from escalating into full-scale            violence.

Celebrated annually            on October 7th, this day encourages            people to recognize, appreciate, and em-            brace inner beauty over external appear-            ances. It serves as an important occasion            to challenge societal norms, promote            self-worth, and advocate for kindness,            compassion, and authenticity.            The origins of national inner            beauty day              National Inner Beauty Day was            founded by Roma Newton, a human            rights advocate and the CEO of the non-            profit organization True Connect, which            focuses on assisting survivors of human            trafficking. Newton established this day            to highlight the inner beauty of people            who have faced adversity and to give            them a platform to showcase their            strength, courage, and resilience.              The day aligns with the mission of            True Connect to fight human trafficking,            providing survivors an opportunity to re-            store their self-esteem, which is often            shattered by exploitation. By emphasiz-            ing inner beauty, Newton hopes to create            a world where individuals are valued for            their inherent qualities, not merely their            physical appearance.             Why inner beauty matters              Inner beauty refers to the qualities            that make a person truly beautiful on the            inside, such as kindness, empathy, com-            passion, intelligence, and integrity.

The role of music in human history              Music has been an integral part of            human civilization for thousands of            years. It has served as a form of expres-            sion, communication, and cultural iden-            tity. Archaeological evidence suggests            that the earliest musical instruments,            such as flutes made from animal bones,            date back as far as 40,000 years.                                                               World-renowned sitar player Anushka Shankar            Throughout history, music has played a            key role in rituals, celebrations, and sto-            rytelling, often reflecting the social and            cultural context of a particular era or so-            ciety.              Ancient civilizations like the Greeks,            Egyptians, and Mesopotamians used            music in religious ceremonies and social            gatherings.
