Who gets to            read the fine print of a job contract and            who is left vulnerable?              Amina and Ramesh’s stories remind            us that the future is not evenly distrib-            uted. Some children walk confidently            into a world of knowledge, while            others are left staring at doors that            never open.              Bridging this divide requires more            than statistics and slogans, it demands            empathy, imagination and persistence.            Literacy, after all, is not just about            letters on a page. It is about the pos-            sibility of a life fully lived. ■             SEPTEMBER 01 2025 | REVOIR Magazine www.revoir.in                                            7","ANALYSIS                                                                                          The price of passion                n classrooms across the globe, mil-              lions of educators face a harsh para-            Idox: while society celebrates their   Underpaid and            noble calling to shape future genera-            tions, it consistently undervalues their            professional worth through inadequate            compensation and overwhelming work-            loads.

Yet his relevance extends            far beyond India’s classrooms. In a frac-            tured and polarised world, where dis-            trust between communities, nations and            even neighbours often overshadows            shared humanity, Radhakrishnan’s vi-            sion feels like a light we keep forgetting            to follow.             A philosopher-statesman rooted in            ethics              Radhakrishnan was no ordinary aca-            demic. Born in 1888 in a modest family            in Tamil Nadu, he rose to become a cele-            brated philosopher, Vice President and            later the second President of India. But            behind the ceremonial titles was a            thinker deeply committed to the ethical            foundations of life.              For him, philosophy was not meant            to be locked away in libraries. It was            meant to serve as a guide to living with            dignity, compassion and moral clarity.

Think of how interfaith initiatives            Radhakrishnan’s thought was his insis-  today, whether communities feeding the            tence on tolerance, not as passive ac-  hungry together, or schools introducing            ceptance, but as active respect.

As President of            intolerance often masquerades as con-            viction. His philosophy cuts through the            noise: to seek unity not by erasing dif-            ferences but by recognizing them as part            of a larger human tapestry.              In global politics too, this vision            matters. Whether it is conflicts in the            Middle East, debates over immigration            in Europe, or cultural clashes in multi-            cultural societies, the ability to see the            other as equally human, and equally en-            titled to dignity, remains the cornerstone            of peace.             Spiritual unity without dogma              Radhakrishnan was not interested in            promoting one religion over another. In-            stead, he saw spirituality as the shared            essence of all traditions.

Followers expect daily doses            of hope, even when life off-screen does-            n’t align.              In this sense, digital positivity can            begin to resemble a mask. It hides real-            ity while projecting a curated form of            resilience. For a teenager navigating            heartbreak or a young professional            struggling with burnout, the endless            stream of perfection and optimism can            make them feel out of step, like they’re            the only ones not coping gracefully.            The role of randomness and            probability              Life, of course, doesn’t operate on            hashtags. It operates on probability.

Some, like Hon-            est Amish or The Man Company, have            built entire identities around the modern            bearded man. The narrative is simple but            powerful: a beard isn’t just hair; it’s a            lifestyle.             Tradition meets modern grooming              While the commercial side of beards            grabs attention, cultural practices around            them remain deeply rooted. Nowhere is            this more visible than in the Sikh com-            munity. For Sikhs, the beard is not a            style choice but an article of faith, sym-            bolizing dignity, acceptance and spiritu-            ality. Maintaining it, however, requires            daily care.              Many Sikhs use products like natural            oils to keep their beards soft and healthy.            Some rely on beard fixers or setting            sprays to maintain shape, especially dur-            ing long workdays. There’s also the Tha-            tha or Thathi, a simple piece of cloth            tied around the beard to keep it neat,            particularly while sleeping or working.
