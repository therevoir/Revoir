Early Life and Education              Born into a family of intellectuals            and scholars in Hyderabad, Sarojini            Naidu's childhood was steeped in an at-            mosphere of learning and cultural rich-            ness. Her father, Aghornath Chattopad-            hyay, was a distinguished scientist,            philosopher, and educator, while her            mother, Barada Sundari Devi, was a po-            etess.
