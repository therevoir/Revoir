Estab-            lished by the Food and Agriculture Or-            ganization (FAO) of the United Nations            in 1979, the day is an occasion to pro-            mote awareness of global hunger issues            and highlight the importance of food se-            curity, agricultural sustainability, and re-            sponsible consumption. World Food Day            serves as a reminder of the inequalities            in food distribution and urges individ-            uals, communities, and governments to            act toward creating a hunger-free world.            Historical background and            importance              World Food Day marks the founding            of the FAO in 1945, a critical organiza-            tion formed after World War II to ad-            dress global food shortages and agricul-            tural reconstruction. The day was            proposed by Dr. Pal Romany, the Hun-            garian Minister of Agriculture, and was            adopted by FAO member countries in            1979. Since then, it has grown to include            participation from over 150 nations,            making it one of the most celebrated            days across the globe.

The            first synchronized sound cartoon,            \"Steamboat Willie,\" starring Mickey            Mouse, was released by Walt Disney in            1928, revolutionizing the animation in-            dustry. This innovation led to the golden            age of animation, during which classic            animated films such as \"Snow White            and the Seven Dwarfs,\" \"Bambi,\" and            \"Cinderella\" were produced.

The introduction of            computer-generated imagery (CGI) in            the late 20th century transformed the in-            dustry once again.
