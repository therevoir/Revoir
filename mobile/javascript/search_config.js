In many            Asian cultures, particularly in China and            India, white is the color of mourning            and is traditionally worn at funerals. The            use of white in these traditions is tied to            ideas of the afterlife and the soul’s tran-            sition beyond the physical world.

Meanwhile, tech            companies lean on blue to project reli-            ability and trustworthiness, as seen with            LinkedIn, Twitter and PayPal.

Even the way colors are            used in social media posts affects en-            gagement, with studies suggesting that            bright, saturated images attract more in-            teraction than muted tones.              Additionally, emojis, miniature picto-            rial symbols, have developed their own            color-based meanings. The red heart            emoji universally signifies love, while            the green one might indicate jealousy or            environmental consciousness. These            digital expressions have subtly reshaped            how we associate color with emotion            and communication.
