The pandemic has            underscored the essential role of front-            line workers—from healthcare profes-            sionals to delivery drivers—and sparked            renewed appreciation for their contrib-            utions. It has also highlighted the need            for robust social protections, including            healthcare, paid sick leave, and unem-            ployment benefits, to safeguard workers'            well-being in times of crisis.
