Often associated with            stage performances or therapeutic ses-            sions, hypnosis is more than an enig-            matic phenomenon; it’s a tool for in-            fluencing thoughts, behaviors, and            perceptions. In everyday life, subtle            forms of hypnosis play a crucial role in            shaping our actions and decisions, often            without our conscious awareness.

The science behind hypnosis              Modern research has demystified            many aspects of hypnosis, revealing its            basis in brain function. Functional mag-            netic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies            show that hypnosis affects areas of the            brain associated with attention, emotion,            and self-awareness.              During hypnosis, activity in the            brain’s default mode network decreases,            quieting the critical inner voice that            often resists change. This allows the            subconscious mind to become more re-            ceptive to suggestions, facilitating be-            havioral and emotional transformation.
