Workplace safety: Men, particularly            in labor-intensive jobs like construction            and manufacturing, are at higher risk of            workplace injuries and fatalities. On            IMD, attention is drawn to policies and            practices that can make workplaces safer            for everyone, highlighting the impor-            tance of health and safety protocols.                                                           Men participating in a group discussion            Positive role models and            redefining masculinity              International Men’s Day seeks to            redefine and broaden the concept of            masculinity. Traditional expectations of            masculinity often focus on strength,            toughness, and emotional restraint,            which can limit the full expression of a            man’s identity. IMD promotes a more            inclusive view of masculinity, where            kindness, empathy, and responsibility            are equally valued traits.              Positive male role models can be            transformative in society, particularly            for younger generations. Fathers,            teachers, mentors, and community            leaders provide essential guidance and            support, showing that masculinity can            coexist with sensitivity, respect, and care            for others. Stories of men working to            uplift their communities, advocating for            social causes, and leading by example            serve as powerful reminders of the posi-                                                        Man at work            tive impact men can have.            Gender equality and men’s role in            society              International Men’s Day provides an            opportunity to promote gender equality            and celebrate the contributions of men            while recognizing the need for balanced            relationships between genders. Men            have a crucial role in supporting gender            equality, both in the workplace and at            home. Studies show that societies with            greater gender equality see improve-            ments in overall well-being, economic            stability, and mental health for both men            and women.
