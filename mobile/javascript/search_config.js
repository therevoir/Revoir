It’s the begin-              ning of another kind of living. That’s            Ihow 52-year-old Ashok from Pune            describes his journey after being dia-            gnosed with HIV in 1998.

The shift in the story              There was a time, not so long ago,            when an HIV diagnosis meant death was            inevitable. The 1980s and ’90s were            marked by panic, isolation and loss. But            today, the narrative has changed. People            living with HIV are not dying young;            they’re living full, complex and ordinary            lives.              Medical science has turned what was            once a death sentence into a manageable            chronic condition. The three letters,            HIV, no longer carry the same terror            they once did. What’s remarkable is not            just the science, but the quiet revolution            in how people live, love and age with            the virus.            The miracle of modern medicine              The turning point came with antiret-            roviral therapy (ART). Introduced in the            mid-1990s, ART transformed the course            of the disease. Instead of attacking the            immune system unchecked, the virus            could now be suppressed, sometimes to            undetectable levels.
