While lifestyle choices like            diet, exercise and stress management are            commonly discussed, a growing body of            research reveals that the roots of hyper-            tension may lie deeper, within our DNA.

Australia,            Sweden and even Kenya are producing            terroir-driven expressions that reflect            local ingredients, climates and cultures.              This diversity reflects whisky’s            adaptability and its universal appeal.            Though techniques and tastes may vary,            the underlying pursuit is shared: to craft            something meaningful, memorable and            deeply human.              It also reflects the democratization of            whisky. No longer confined to elite cir-            cles, whisky is now for everyone,            whether it’s enjoyed neat in a crystal            glass, stirred into a smoky cocktail, or            sipped over ice under starlight.

Yet in            Khayyam’s life and work, the two were            not only reconciled but made to enhance            one another.

In one of his            most quoted quatrains, he writes:            “The Moving Finger writes; and, having            writ,            Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit            Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,            Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.”              This reflection on time’s irreversibil-            ity echoes the irreversible laws he stud-            ied in the stars. His poetic vision does            not contradict his scientific precision;            rather, it breathes life into it. For Khay-            yam, science revealed the structure of            the universe, while poetry gave voice to            its silence.
