Yet a quiet revolution is            unfolding. Across boardrooms, class-            rooms and policy circles, a care-based            framework is gaining ground. This shift            is not sentimental; it is strategic. As in-            equality deepens and environmental            crises escalate, traditional growth            models are being re-evaluated in favor            of systems that prioritize human well-            being, social cohesion and sustainability.              On the occasion of World Caring            Day, this article investigates whether            empathy and care can be more than            moral aspirations, whether they can            serve as structural pillars for a new kind            of economy. Drawing on international            case studies and interdisciplinary in-            sights, we explore how care-based            models are reshaping business practices,            educational systems and governance            structures across the globe.
