Sweet, yes, but not over-            powering.              Of course, taste isn’t just about the            tongue. It’s about memory. For some,            gulab jamun recalls childhood Diwali            platters or sneaking an extra piece from            the refrigerator late at night. For others,            rasgulla means train journeys through            Bengal where the vendor’s call, “Rosho-            golla!” carried as much joy as the sweet            itself.             Regional pride and identity              Few sweets illustrate regional iden-            tity as vividly as these two. Gulab jamun            is almost pan-Indian; you’ll find it in            every state, whether served plain, cut            into halves with ice cream, or reinvented            by modern chefs into shot glasses and            cheesecakes. It transcends geography.              Rasgulla, by contrast, wears its                                             Left: Artisan mak­            origins loudly.
