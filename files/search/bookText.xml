                 of expression but also a pro-
           Dfound medium for healing.
           Since the dawn of civilization, dance has
           been used to soothe the soul, restore bal-
           ance, and foster emotional and physical
           well-being. Across cultures and eras, it
           has played a vital role in rituals, spiritual
           ceremonies, and community bonding,
           serving as a powerful force for personal
           and collective healing. By transcending
           spoken language, dance connects people
           through movement and emotion, offer-
           ing a path to renewal and wholeness.
           Today, the healing power of dance con-
           tinues to evolve, embracing its role in
           wellness practices, therapy, and holistic
           health, while still honoring its ancient
           roots as a transformative art form.
             Dance is no longer seen solely as a
           means of entertainment or performance;
           rather, it has become a recognized tool
           in the promotion of mental, emotional,
           and physical health. From classical
           dance forms that evoke spirituality to
           modern therapeutic practices designed
           to release trauma, dance continues to
           serve as a powerful medium of healing,
           inviting individuals to find inner peace,
           balance, and connection. This universal
           art form transcends the boundaries of
           culture, geography, and language, mak-
           ing it accessible to all who seek renewal
           through movement.

           prevention
             One of the primary goals of World
           Diabetes Day is to raise awareness about
           preventive measures for diabetes, par-
           ticularly Type 2, which is largely pre-
           ventable through lifestyle changes. Ac-

           diabetes cases can be prevented by
           adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes
           a balanced diet, regular physical activity,
           and avoiding tobacco use.
             Healthy eating: A balanced diet rich
           in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and
           vegetables can help regulate blood sugar
           levels. Reducing the intake of sugary
           foods, processed carbohydrates, and sat-
           urated fats is also crucial.
             Physical activity: Engaging in at least
           150 minutes of moderate aerobic exer-
           cise per week is beneficial for managing
           weight, enhancing insulin sensitivity,
           and reducing stress, which can contrib-
           ute to better blood sugar management.
             Regular screening: Early diagnosis
           through regular blood sugar screening
           can help manage diabetes effectively                                                            Supporting individuals living with diabetes
           and prevent complications. This is espe-
           cially important for those with a family
           history of diabetes or other risk factors.
           The role of insulin and access to
           essential medicine
             While the discovery of insulin
           marked a breakthrough in diabetes treat-
           ment, access to insulin remains a chal-
           lenge, particularly in low-income coun-
           tries. The cost of insulin and other
           essential diabetes medications continues
           to rise, creating a barrier to treatment for
           millions who depend on it for survival.

           The Secret to Success



           The boss is always right






           The phrase “the boss is always right” serves as a reminder of the importance of
           respecting and valuing leadership. Effective bosses offer guidance, mentorship,

           contribute to a larger purpose.
             Experience and expertise: Most
           leaders come into their roles after years
           of experience, equipping them with
           valuable insights into the industry and
           company processes. They often have a
           well-developed understanding of what                                                            Handshake between an employee and his boss
           works and what doesn’t. By valuing this
           expertise, employees can avoid common
           pitfalls and work more effectively.
             Decision-making authority: Bosses
           often carry the responsibility of making
           tough calls, such as setting priorities,
           distributing resources, or managing con-
           flicts. Acknowledging that they are best
           positioned to make these choices can
           help teams avoid unnecessary friction,
           focusing their efforts on achieving set
           goals.
             Ability to navigate challenges:
           Leaders are generally well-prepared to
           handle challenges. Their experience al-
           lows them to anticipate potential issues
           and take proactive steps to address them.
           When employees align with a leader’s
           approach to problem-solving, they can
           manage unexpected obstacles more
           smoothly, learning valuable resilience in                                                       Boss at a whiteboard during a presentation

             The fountain pen is more than the
           sum of its parts; it is a synergy of art and
           engineering, each element working to-
           gether to deliver a writing experience
           that is smooth, responsive, and deeply
           personal.

           The appeal of writing with fountain
           pens
             Fountain pens offer a writing experi-
           ence that is quite distinct from that of                                                        A vintage feather pen
           ballpoint or rollerball pens. The flow of
           ink is controlled yet fluid, giving the
           writer a sense of grace in each stroke.
           Fountain pens require only a light touch,
           which reduces hand strain and allows
           for longer, more comfortable writing
           sessions.
             For many, fountain pens are also an
           expression of personality. Unlike most
           disposable pens, fountain pens come in
           various designs, from minimalist models
           to intricate designs with precious metals
           and gemstones. Collectors and enthusi-
           asts are drawn to fountain pens not just
           for utility but also for their aesthetic
           value, treating each pen as a piece of                                                          Vintage fountain pen with an ink pot
